# 2048
2048 is a single player puzzle game. What makes it tricky is that everytime a random tile is placed so it's hard to come up with a strategy that works everytime. The "plan" for this project is to come up with a clever strategy that ensures winning (or at least dramatically increases probabilty of winning without using neural net)
